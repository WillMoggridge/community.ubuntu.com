        The Ubuntu Forums represent many people&rsquo;s first meeting with
        Ubuntu. They are an important resource for support and social
        interactions. The forums were started as an independent project in 2004
        and their rapid success was officially recognized when they were
        designated as the Official Ubuntu Forums.
