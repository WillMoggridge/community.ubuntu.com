        We want Ubuntu to be great across all kinds of devices &mdash; a great
        phone and tablet experience. It is an open source platform which will
        power a wide range of devices. In no time it has attracted an
        enthusiastic and vibrant community, which works both on the platform
        itself and porting it to new devices.
