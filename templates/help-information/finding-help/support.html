        If you are stuck on a problem, someone else has probably encountered it
        too. Take a look at the
        <a href="http://help.ubuntu.com/" class="p-link--external">

        If you would rather ask questions directly to the Ubuntu Community,
        you can
        <a href="/contribute/support/irc/">
          access our Internet relay chat (IRC) channel
        </a>.

          our instructions</a> for how to join the live chat. Then login to
        irc.freenode.net and join the #ubuntu channel. There are also
        dedicated channels for development, bugs, local community (LoCo)
        teams, accessibility and documentation.

        This is a collaboratively edited question and answer site for Ubuntu
        users and developers. If you&rsquo;re looking to ask questions on how
        to use your Ubuntu computer, then this is the place to go. Instead of
        posting like a mailing list or forum, this site works by you repeatedly
        editing your question with what you&rsquo;ve learned about your
        problem, and then users can rate the quality of the questions and
        answers by voting. If you&rsquo;re interested in learning how the site
        works, check out
        <a href="https://meta.askubuntu.com/questions/257/how-does-ask-ubuntu-work"

        This site is English only, if you need support in another language,
        see Launchpad Answers below.

        <a href="https://answers.launchpad.net/" class="p-link--external">
          Launchpad</a>.
        Keep your query active until a community member offers the answer you
        need. You can also search the complete history of questions and
        answers. This site supports multiple-languages.

        Sometimes support is more than just helping each other all day, hanging
        out with other people who use Ubuntu is also a good way to learn and
        make new friends. Sometimes you just want to kick back, relax, and talk
        about Ubuntu with the rest of the community.
